"yes so what i did today was to correct the preprocessing of the code in the file 'pura.ipynb'and  what all has been done in 
each checkpoint has been mentioned at the top of each check point file as a note.

PS: i removed all data visualization before starting with anything so make sure to add also those from the 'pura.ipynb'"
